# funPython
This repo contains some fun python scripts to automate some of my work or some of the scripts that I use frequently.

* Merge multiple pdf files into one file.
* Make a video from a list or set of images. 
* Extract frames from a video (to be added)

Most of the code are collected from online and stackoverflow. 

Thanks to the original coders.
